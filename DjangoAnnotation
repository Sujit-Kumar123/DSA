# # Dango Annotation question answer.
# 1.What is annotation in Django?
#     Annotation in Django is used to add calculated fields to queryset results. 
#     It allows you to compute values dynamically based on fields in the model or related models.
# 2.How is annotate() different from aggregate() in Django?
#     annotate(): Adds a calculated field to each record in the queryset.
#     aggregate(): Returns a single value for the entire queryset (e.g., sum, count).
# 3.What types of calculations can you perform with annotations?
#     You can perform aggregations like Sum, Count, Avg, Min, and Max, as well as custom expressions using F, Case, When, and other Django ORM tools.
# 4.How would you calculate the total price of items in an order using annotation?
    from django.db.models import F, Sum
    orders = Order.objects.annotate(total_price=Sum(F('quantity') * F('price')))
# 5.Can you use annotations to filter a queryset?
#     Yes, but you need to use annotate() first, then filter using the calculated field.
    products = Product.objects.annotate(total_sales=Sum('order_items__quantity'))
               .filter(total_sales__gte=100)
# 6.How would you annotate the number of related objects for each instance?
    from django.db.models import Count
    authors = Author.objects.annotate(book_count=Count('books'))
# 7.How would you annotate a queryset using conditional logic?
    from django.db.models import Case, When, IntegerField
    orders = Order.objects.annotate(
        high_value=Case(
            When(total_price__gte=500, then=1),
            default=0,
            output_field=IntegerField()
        )
    )
# 8.Can annotations reference other annotations?
    Yes, annotations can reference other annotations within the same queryset.
    orders = Order.objects.annotate(
              total=Sum(F('price') * F('quantity')),
              discount_price=F('total') * 0.9
              )
# 9.What happens if you use annotate() with distinct() in a queryset?
    # Using distinct() in combination with annotate() can sometimes lead to unexpected results, as it might alter the aggregation behavior.
# 10.How would you annotate users who have placed at least one order in the past month?
    from django.db import models
    from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
    from django.utils.timezone import now
    from datetime import timedelta
    
    # Custom User model
    class User(AbstractUser):
        # Additional fields if needed
        email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    
        def __str__(self):
            return self.username
    
    
    # Order model
    class Order(models.Model):
        user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='orders')
        created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
        total_price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    
        def __str__(self):
            return f"Order {self.id} - User: {self.user.username}"

    from django.utils.timezone import now
    from django.db.models import Count
    
    last_month = now() - timedelta(days=30)
    users = User.objects.annotate(
        recent_orders=Count(
            'orders',
            filter=Q(orders__created_at__gte=last_month)

    from django.db.models import F, Sum
    products = Product.objects.annotate(profit=F('selling_price') - F('cost_price'))
# 13.How can you annotate a queryset with a subquery?
    # Use Subquery to perform a nested query as part of the annotation.
    from django.db.models import Subquery, OuterRef
    latest_order_date = Order.objects.filter(user_id=OuterRef('pk')).order_by('-date').values('date')[:1]
    users = User.objects.annotate(last_order_date=Subquery(latest_order_date))
# 14.What is the difference between using annotate() and using raw SQL in Django for custom calculations?
#         annotate() provides ORM abstraction and works seamlessly with Django models, 
#         while raw SQL can handle complex queries not easily supported by the ORM but at the cost of losing portability and readability.
# 15.How would you annotate the percentage contribution of each product's sales to the total sales?
        from django.db.models import Sum, F, FloatField
        total_sales = Product.objects.aggregate(total=Sum(F('quantity') * F('price')))['total']

        )

    # use Window with annotations for advanced analytics like ranks or running totals.

    from django.db.models.functions import Rank

                    When(category='Clothing', then=2),
                    default=0,
                    output_field=IntegerField()
                )
            )

    products = Product.objects.annotate(
        cumulative_sales=Window(Sum('sales'), order_by=F('date').asc())
    )
# 22.How does Prefetch differ from annotate() for related fields?
    # Prefetch is used to optimize queries by preloading related fields, while annotate() adds calculated fields to a queryset.
# 23.How would you optimize a query that uses both annotate() and select_related()?
    # Use select_related() for loading related models in the same query and ensure annotate() fields do not create unnecessary joins.
# 24.Can you use annotations with ValuesQuerySet?
